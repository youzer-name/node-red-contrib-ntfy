# Node-RED Contrib Ntfy

A Node-RED node to send notifications to an [Ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/) server.

## What's New in This Fork?

This fork adds several enhancements and features beyond the original:


### Enhanced Message Properties
- `markdown` (boolean): Enables Markdown formatting.
- `sequenceId`: Set sequence ID for notification.  Enables update/delete/clear commands.
  - Send another message with the same sequenceId to update an existing notification
  - Use the clear/delete node with the same sequenceId to clear or delete a notification

### Added ntfy update node
- Use this node to clear or delete an existing notification

### Change to property override logic
- Values set in the node editor now take precedence over values in the incoming message
  - This means an incoming message with a msg.topic set will not override the configured ntfy topic
